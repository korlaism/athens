If you have any input on how you want this project to unfold, please join our Discord.

Our Discord is a safe space, meant for learning and improvement (especially about Clojure!).

We also talk about topics like visual & interactive knowledge graphs (HCI), knowledge markets (economics), open protocols (governance & philosophy), other applications of bi-directional links and graph DBs, and other Tools for Thought.

You don't need to code to contribute. But it is encouraged ðŸ˜‰
